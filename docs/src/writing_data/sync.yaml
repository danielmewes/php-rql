      <code>sync</code> ensures that writes on a given table are written to permanent storage.
      Queries that specify soft durability (<code>array('durability' => 'soft')</code>) do not give such guarantees,
      so <code>sync</code> can be used to ensure the state of these queries.
      A call to <code>sync</code> does not return until all previous writes to the table are persisted.

    body:
      ph: "$PARENT->sync()"

    io:
      - - table
        - object

    examples:
      - description: After having updated multiple heroes with soft durability, we now want to wait until these changes are persisted.
        code:
          ph: r\table('marvel')->sync()->run($conn);
